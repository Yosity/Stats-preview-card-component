This challenge was tougher than it looked,
The responsive design was more complex than any previous challenge but still I got the job done :).

I heavily used flexbox and I believe it was the optimal choice.

I learned about mix blends that helped me color the overlay.
I'm more than happy to see what tips and opinions you guys can give...
